This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the path="/*" route in React Router Dom v6.  The problem arises when this catch-all route is placed after more specific routes.  Even when a path matches a previous route, the catch-all route will always be rendered. The solution involves carefully ordering the routes, ensuring that more specific paths are listed *before* the catch-all route.  This ensures that more specific routes are checked before the catch-all.
